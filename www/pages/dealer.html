                           <h3  style="text-align: center;">ROULETTE</h3>

                             The objective is to predict the number on which the ball will land by placing one or more bets that cover that particular number. The wheel in European Roulette includes the numbers 1-36 plus a single 0 (zero).
                             After betting time has expired, the ball is spun within the Roulette wheel. The ball will eventually come to rest in one of the numbered pockets within the wheel. You win if you have placed a bet that covers that particular number.

                             Bet Types
                             You can place many different kinds of bets on the Roulette table. Bets can cover a single number or a certain range of numbers, and each type of bet has its own payout rate.
                             Bets made on the numbered spaces on the betting area, or on the lines between them, are called Inside Bets, while bets made on the special boxes below and to the side of the main grid of numbers are called Outside Bets.


                             <h3  style="text-align: center;">INSIDE BETS:</h3>

                                 Straight Up - place your chip directly on any single number (including zero).
                                 Split Bet - place your chip on the line between any two numbers, either on the vertical or horizontal.
                                 Street Bet - place your chip at the end of any row of numbers. A Street Bet covers three numbers.
                                 Corner Bet - place your chip at the corner (central intersection) where four numbers meet. All four numbers are covered.
                             Five Bet - place your chip on the outer boundary line of the betting grid between 0 and 1 (at the point where the bottom-right corner of the number 0 meets the bottom-left corner of the number one). A Five Bet covers five numbers: 0, 00, 1, 2 and 3.
                             Line Bet - place your chip at the end of two rows on the intersection between the two rows. A line bet covers all the numbers in both rows, a total of six numbers.

                             Column Bet  - place your chip in one of the boxes marked "2 to 1" at the end of the column that covers all 12 numbers in that column. The zero is not covered by any column bet.
                             Dozen Bet - place your chip in one of the three boxes marked "1st 12," "2nd 12" or "3rd 12" to cover the 12 numbers alongside the box.
                             Red/Black - place your chip in the Red or Black box to cover the 18 red or 18 black numbers. The zero is not covered by these bets.
                             Even/Odd - place your chip in one of these boxes to cover the 18 even or 18 odd numbers. The zero is not covered by these bets.
                             1-18/19-36 - place your chip in either of these boxes to cover the first or second set of 18 numbers. The zero is not covered by these bets.
